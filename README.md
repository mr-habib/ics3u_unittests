# ICS3U Unit Tests
Your job is to create unit tests for the provided function in main.py.
If you need help writing them, take a look at how I've done them in all of your (newer) repos.

This assignment will be interesting because the auto-grader will pass if the tests you write pass. I promise my function won't contain any errors, so your auto grader should always pass. The key here is coming up with appropriate tests for this function.

I'll be looking for two categories of test cases: normal test cases, and "edge" cases.

Edge cases are inputs to functions that are technically correct, but often cause little errors in our code. Common edge casess include empty lists, 0, negative numbers, empty strings, and so on.

If you need help thinking of edge cases, google shall be your friend.

This assignment will be out of 10.

## Note: To test your main_test.py follow these instructions:
1. Click on the "shell" tab where the python console is
2. Type
```bash
$ pip3 install pytest
```
(Do not include the $)
3. Once installed, type:
```bash
$ pytest
```
and watch the green come alive!
